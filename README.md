# :cow: Bulls-And-Cows-Game
Using OOP concepts to create the classic Bulls and Cows (a.k.a. Mastermind) game. 

Included is the ability for the user to choose their prefered difficulty level between Easy, Medium and Hard. Easy will simply ask the computer to randomly generate a 4-digit code, Medium will ensure the computer doesn't make the same guess twice; and Hard will use an algorithm to strategically guess the player's secret code in under 7 guesses.
